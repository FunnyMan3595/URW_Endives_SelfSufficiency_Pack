--Rains Ironworking Mod-- v0.91

Not quite ready for release, but good enough to post. Figured I should dump this asap before Skyrim comes out and I get distracted.

Items that can be made:

    Knife
    Spear
    Handaxe
    Woodsman's Axe
    Shortsword
    Sickle
    Shortsword
    Mace (as "Hammer")
    Shovel
    Large Ring Cowl
    Ring shirt
    Long Ring Hauberk
    Ring Leggings
    Ring Gauntlets
    Pot

Quick and dirty directions:

    Go to a mire and dig up bog iron
    make one or more big charcoal piles (5 day burn time)
    Smelt the bog iron into blooms (loses 80% of mass, 1 day burn time)
    Make first an anvil, then a hammer out of the blooms
    Hammer the blooms into wrought iron
    Make a variety of blades out of wrought iron
    hammer, temper, and sharpen those blades
    attach them to handles

Most steps involve the use of charcoal as fuel. Expect to make several batches. I intentionally made this very labor intensive to make up for how easy the iron is to get.

The charcoal pile should be kept on the ground next to your forge area, as should the anvil. Keeping a fire lit is required for almost all steps.

When making ring armor, you'll need new versions (or several worn copies) of leather armor to make the various pieces - you can not make a ring shirt out of a 1lb 80% damaged leather shirt - you need a full 6lbs.

I decided against using an iron plant for a number of reasons - it never worked well enough to my satisfaction.

Release version will be submitted to Sami along with an update to my cloth mod, followed by a bundle mod that includes both, revamped menus and many other items made using the two technologies.
