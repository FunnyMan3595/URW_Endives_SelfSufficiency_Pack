Rain's Clothing Mod v2
Compatible with Unreal World 3.13 patch 3

This is a mod for the game Unreal World by Sami Maaranen and Erkka Lehmus. It was developed using the new modding system added and with support from the developers by Jeff Craig (aka Rain)
In many ways it was intended to showcase some of the verstility in the current modding langauge, in particular the {* item} and [name] markers. 
For Support Questions or Newer Versions go to the mod's thread on the Urw Forum:

Installation:
-------------
Place all files in your main Urw directory.
diy_Rainsclothv2.txt contains all the item definitions.
menudef_Rainsclothv2.txt sets up the submenus in the games "make" menu.

Features:
---------
*Prepare linen or nettle cloth from the plant through a realistic and balanced multi-step process.
*Use that cloth along with existing clothing to create linen or nettle clothing of your choice.
*Re-use old woolen clothing to make new woolen garments of your choice.
*Cloth is usable as bandages, thread is tying equipment as well.
*Includes recipes for some easy string (ideal for drying or arrows), hemp rope and bags.
*No new tools needed. In various steps a club, wooden stake, rock and knife (preferably a small knife) are used.

Directions to use in the game:
------------------------------
*Harvest your nettles or hemp. Do not thresh them!
*Soak them in water (it helps to do this near a river/pond/lake)
*They will soak and rot for 14 days.
*Take the Retted materials and "extract fibre". You will need a club and will lose half the weight. The mod will track what kind of fibre it is (nettle vs hemp)
*The fibres can be used to spin thread using a wooden stake (distaff) and rock (spindle). The mod will track what kind of thread it is (nettle vs hemp)
*Having two slender trunks and two ropes on the ground next to you, you can then weave the thread in cloth of the right type using a backstrap loom.
*With the help of a knife and ample tying equipment (rope, thread, string, cord) you can then tailor new linen or nettle clothes out of the cloth or old garments.

Plans for Version 3 (when the needed modding options are developed):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*Replace the placeholder backstrap loom with a constructed, fixed-placement warp weighted loom.
*Changing the weaving into a more realistic multi-stage event to be completed over several days or months, yielding one large cloth that can then be divided up.
*Define custom tools (beyond just renaming existing items) for a Spindle & Distaff, Needle, Scutching Comb etc.
